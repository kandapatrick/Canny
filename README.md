The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It an image processing method used to detect edges in an image while suppressing noise.It extracts useful structural information from different vision objects and dramatically reduce the amount of data to be processed. It has been widely applied in various computer vision systems. Canny has found that the requirements for the application of edge detection on diverse vision systems are relatively similar.
